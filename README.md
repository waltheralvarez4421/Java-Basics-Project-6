# Java-Beginner-Project-6

Beginner project completed during my Master's program. 

This program prompts the user to first input a sequence of numbers and then a second set of numbers.
Through the use of a method it then merges two array lists, alternating elements from both array lists. 
If one array list is shorter than the other, 
then it alternates as long as is needed and then appends the remaining elements from the longer array list.
